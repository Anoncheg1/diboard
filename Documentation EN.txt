1.1 Filter empty articles at Web-frontend

The following rules are applying:
If Message is empty there is must be Subject and Attachment.
If Message is not empty: for thread there is must Subject or Attachment,
for replay Message is enough.

new replay:

1 message.length() != 0
2 subject.length() != 0
3 file.getSize() != 0
( 1 or (2 and 3) ) or (2 and 3)
( 1 or (2 and 3) )
-( 1 and (2 or 3) )    negative form for "== 0"

new thread:

1 message.length() == 0
2 subject.length() == 0
3 file.getSize() == 0
( 1 AND (2 OR 3) ) OR (2 AND 3) 

1.2 Message source fingerprint problem and flood protection

If every server has no identity there is no source fingerprint problem (SFP) but it is impossible to prevent such network from growing and
protect against flood and network growing.

If servers has names or any identities then for SFP one of following condition required:
1 many small nodes
2 one-four users at one of the server

Nntpchan software has no restritions on naming except one: DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM)
which used to protect against flood.

Nntpchan network has many signed small nodes with one-four users.
Users will settle in most popular server in attemt to hide article source fingerprint.
Such centralization is bad for whole network.

To solve this problems diboard uses two modes at same time: 
one for mutual network with nntpchan software
and another for separate networks of groups.
