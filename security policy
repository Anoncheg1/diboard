Priorities:
1) each node by itself
2) users connection
3) users fingerprints

1) includes:
	1.1 peer-to-peer: tor/i2p + TLS connection
	1.2 prevent correlation attacks: where it is possible random intervals used.
	perils:
	- reading fronted. No protection.
	- ISP traffic analysis. No protection
	- compromised connected peer. No protection.
	- compromised distant peer. For networking groups user source fingerprint may leak without detection.

2) includes:
	2.1 Tor or I2p
	2.2 optional HTTPS for more encryption
	2.3 prevent correlation attacks:
	TODO:Optional message padding
	TODO:transfer but delay publication or delay publication at all.
	
3) includes:
	3.1 for overchan: clear message-id and no PATH header,
		for diboard-groups: hidden message-id

Both the times and the quantities of ciphertext transfer are subject for correlation attacks.
