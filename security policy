Priorities:
1) each node by itself
2) user connection
3) user fingerprints

1) includes:
	1.1 peer-to-peer: tor/i2p + TLS connection
	1.2 prevent correlation attacks(see 1):
	perils:
	- r/w fronted. No protection.
	- ISP traffic analysis.
	Diboard uses random delays and data quantity
	where it don't slow down network and violate protocol.
	You may try to hide traffic in encrypted flow of tor or i2p.
	- compromised connected peer. No protection.
	- compromised distant peer.

2) includes:
	2.1 Tor or I2p
	2.2 optional HTTPS for more encryption
	2.3 prevent correlation attacks:
	TODO:Optional message padding
	TODO:transfer but delay publication or delay publication at all.
	
3) includes:
	3.1 for overchan: clear message-id and no PATH header,
		for diboard-groups: hidden message-id at web-frontends of the groups.
	Knew issue:
	For networking groups user source fingerprint may leak at compromised server without detection.


	
[1] Both the times and the quantities of ciphertext transfer are subject for correlation attacks.
